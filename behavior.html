        <p style="padding: 1em; padding-left: 0;">Solitary, nocturnal and rather shy. great difficulty in obtaining samples and tissues, observing, and not risk free, making studies pretty rare. Skeletons are also relatively scarce.</p>
         <p style="padding: 1em; padding-left: 0;">In core area territory, Jaguars prefer bigger prey species, with a fondness for reptiles and turtles. They also consume capybara, deer, and tapir. While jaguars consume caiman, they are not caiman experts. This is merely conjecture. Cougars commonly hunt on caimans, sometimes more than Jaguars depending on location. Nevertheless, caimans are likely the weakest crocodilian given their size. Placental mammalian predators routinely feed on them. Jaguars hunt and ambush prey in the same way as other panthera do. However, only the jaguar's canines are powerful enough to puncture through the skull. They also prefer to hunt near water or dive deep for aquatic prey. They may drag prey to a different location for proper cover, as they are powerful enough to clutch in their jaws even in tough terrain. They mostly hunt at night, however they do sometimes hunt during the day. The pattern of activity changes greatly depending on prey quantity and the activity of nearby disturbances.</p>

        <p style="padding: 1em; padding-left: 0;">While territorial, they are not a forceful attacker towards other jaguars, and may cohabit with other large cats. They utilize tree raking, spraying, and scraping the ground with their rear paws to mark their territory. Most frequent vocalizations, which are detectable over vast distances, are occasionally utilized to promote or preserve home range. These are also known as roars and are low-pitched and generated by shifting the larynx lower. Chuffing is also characterized by a succession of low-intensity brief snorts.</p> 
        <p style="padding: 1em; padding-left: 0;">
            Their ranges occasionally overlap, are claimed and altered, and are influenced by prey, jaguar size, and seasonal terrain fluctuations. This variability makes monitoring difficult, as does the extensive environment. A core area is usually reserved for exclusive usage inside a home range. When a territory owner dies, the ranges of others reshape. Before establishing a home range, young males will wander and travel widely. Young littermates may travel together and retain social relationships before parting.Temporary relationships are also observed in courting partners that travel and eat together, and mothers may form relationships with their cubs and care for them until they are a few years old.</p>

        <br><br>
                   Jaguars may attack domestic livestock, provoking farmers to retaliate, despite being categorized as a "can't hunt" species almost everywhere. Farmers are concerned about jaguars preying on their livestock since the area is mostly cattle pasture. But, assuring them that they would be able to get a trophy jaguar in the future may reassure them. However, it is unlikely to occur in practice since it has the potential to be a significant financial drain for conservation. Wildlife organizations are collaborating to lure jaguars to expand their current range into their historical region, thereby reducing the focus on domestic livestock. It's important to realize these kind of programs must first receive consistent funding.
                    <br><br>
                People will complain about a jaguar attacking, but they only see one side of the story, and no one discusses about nautiluses since the focus is on what people want to hear. A dying species, on the other hand, is a modest piece in a nature magazine, if that. Then there are some that let them be hunted for their pelts just because they look neat.

        <strong>Mutual Trust: Animal and Keeper</strong>
        <br><br>
                    In captivity, they're likely only in cages with jaguar-tolerant animals; otherwise, that's live capybara hunting in the zoo. The confidence of an animal in captivity, as well as their assurance of their surroundings and that they have control and enrichment, is an important part of caring for an animal in captivity. Enrichment of the jaguar, where they've been trained to do specific activities resulting from a bond between the handler and the animal, is best for the jaguar if it's fully voluntary and they're rewarded for it.
                    <br><br>
                    Animal handlers should make every effort to establish a positive working relationship with the animals. This is an important aspect of animal care. Collaboration is an incredible element of what animal handlers do since they are frequently faced with unpredictable situations. It is the responsibility of them to be prepared and vigilant at all times, monitoring what might affect change in behavior. I'm curious how jaguar training would go if neither the keeper nor the jaguar had these experiences to share as a result of their teamwork, no mutual trust.
